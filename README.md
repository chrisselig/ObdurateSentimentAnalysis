#Summary
The goal of this analysis was to jump into my first foray into text analysis using data from someone I was pretty familiar with, my brother (aka Obdurate).  Whenever we see movies, especially together, we like to discuss our thoughts and our ratings for the movies to see how we agree/disagree with the other's comments.  

Using the data from his [Criticker account](https://www.criticker.com/profile/Obdurate), I explored his 1900+ movie reviews using [Sentiment Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) in R.  Sentiment analysis is used to identify the overall sentiment in a text data set.

The raw data was accessed March 29th, 2017 and can be found on my github page, along with the associated R code so you can reproduce my analysis.
