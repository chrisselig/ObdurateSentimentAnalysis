  <summary>A unique cinematic journey, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; travels across enormous distances of both space and time. The story it tells is on the one hand about the collective adventure of human life on and off this planet. But it is also about something lying beyond the bounds of humanity, something lying in the true realms of the mysterious.</summary>
  <quote>It innovated, doesn't feel boring and genuinely scares me. The monolith terrifies me and the beginning does too. It is claustrophobic even though it takes place in space which could be infinite. My favourite Kubrick and necessary viewing.</quote>

  <summary>Adonis Johnson never knew his famous father,world heavy weight champion Apollo Creed, who died before he was born. Still, there's no denying that boxing is in his blood, so Adonis heads to Philadelphia, the site of Apollo Creed's legendary match with a tough upstart named Rocky Balboa. Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo - the fierce rival who became his closest friend. (Rotten Tomatoes)</summary>
  <quote>Not the best Rocky movie (and yes, I have ranked a few of them 100 because I have no objectivity) but it's damn good. Coogler brings a different feel to the franchise; it's grimmer but it still has moments of lightness. It's Jordan's best performance and Stallone is once again BRILLIANT as Rocky. The final boxing match is a short film in itself, like they all have been. Coogler brings his own flavour but keeps the Rocky spirit alive. It's hard not to feel way too many emotions during it.</quote>

  <summary>A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and adopts the alter ego Deadpool. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>100 because I'm not afraid to give 100s (I don't see them as meaning 'perfect') and because I adore Deadpool and they did Deadpool right. Reynolds is fantastic, the action is not the best of the Marvel movies (Ant-Man is, I said it) but it's still wholly inspired. However, it's easily the funniest of the bunch, and the best. If you think some of the jokes are cringeworthy, that's kind of the point: Deadpool doesn't shut up and not everything he says is brilliant. That's what I love! </quote>

  <summary>Recorded live in London, England, this nine-(masked)-man band performs a live concert full of chaos, pyros, light effects, and 15 songs of heavy metal from their first two albums. Shot with over 30 cameras, including ones on strapped on some of the members' masks and instruments. Also includes backstage footage before and after the show. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>You know, in terms of live dvds, it really doesn't get any better than this. Mind you, this is a Slipknot fanboy speaking, a guy who's grown up with them, really... so liking a band will heavily influence a decision. However, they were beasts live, they had the 'theatre' aspect of performances down pact, great songs, a lot of energy. I beat myself up about what to rate it, since I'm rating concert dvds on a different scale... but it's my favourite of its kind so hence the 100.</quote>

  <quote>Shit yes. I'm tuned into Refn. I've only seen this and Valhalla Rising  and they've both been really different from one another and stylish, interesting, very cool. I was destined to like this... homages to Kenneth Anger, dedication to Jodorowsky, Ryan Gosling, the retro style (which is now artsy since it's not 1980). There are a lot of memorable moments in here, the violence is gruesome but not overdone. There are just a lot of interesting ideas in here... and they're all done really well.</quote>

  <quote>This movie makes me conflicted. There's blatant animal abuse but it's such a well made film. Does showing animal abuse to make a point make it right? The dwarfs are ripping apart the very world that mocks them. Their acts of rebellion are sometimes boring, sometimes funny, sometimes clever, and the movie challenges you in that way.

  <quote>Enough has been said about Daniel Day-Lewis. The story itself works on multiple levels. The music is loud and abrasive, often to the point of excess, along with sometimes seeming out of place. I think that is the point because often the music drives ahead at full force while the action on the screen is slowed down. The editing is pitch perfect, building tension the entire time. The ending is both hilarious and tragic, making the movie work as both a dramatic character study and black comedy.</quote>

  <quote>Truly brilliant script. It's unfortunate that it's taken me this long to see it. It's amazing that you have heard some of the classic lines so many times but then when you hear them delivered (mostly by Bogart), there's an entire emotional/cool depth to 'em that make them sound fresh. That's both a compliment to him and the script. Everything else about the movie is great. It's simple on the surface but it tells a classic romance about people in hard, oppressive times. Also, Ingrid is beautiful.</quote>

  <quote>I could probably rate all Nolan Batman movies a 100 but I gotta pick one (TDK). And I'm Batman fanboying real hard here but I can honestly say there are very few movies that I enjoy more. There are very very minor gripes (THERE ARE VERY MINOR GRIPES IN ALL MOVIES FOR ME), and that's about it. All characters were handled well. The action moved along, the first fight with Bane was amazing. Uses sound, visuals well, need more space in this review. Interesting to see Batman brought more to light.</quote>

Also has great cinematography, that really showcases the symbolism. Loaded heavily with subtle metaphors for liberty and other things. Acting was great. Some adult material. Can be a little depressing however it is also uplifting in the way that music mends her. A careful meditation on art, such as music.

  <quote>Sometimes it's hard to wrap your head around it. I knew I'd like this, I was destined to, but I liked it even more than I thought I would. The conversations with the cast in the room are riveting... you could listen to them discuss the film/director all day. Where one person on here said the movie needed some closure, I felt like the last scene was completely perfect... that guy ranting and raving, then they all walk off after that, showcasing the reality of the movie: anything can happen. </quote>

  <quote>One of my favourite movies of 2011 now and hell, with a rating like I gave it... it ranks highly up there in my fave movies ever. An amazing performance by everyone, especially Shannon who I really like anyway. It's got some surrealism, beautiful visuals, an interesting sci-fi premise-meets-psychological drama going on. It's terrifying when it tries, deeply emotional as well. Great ending, a lot to think about, masterfully crafted. Just wow.</quote>

Sure, the ending is a little Hollywoodish, but it makes thematic sense so it's forgiven. Great performances, great music, great dialogue.

  <quote>It's not quite the same 95 was Sicario was but this movie is amazing. Kubrick would be proud of this as it's super intelligent, yet also touches on some simplistic and emotional subjects. It's very meta because we ask what their purpose for being here is, but what is ours? They mentioned something about feelings/language, and Villeneuve embraces that; he's a master of mood more than anything, making you feel something with the droney music, the silence, everything. </quote>

  <quote>First off, gotta give love to Portman who plays both a fragile, innocent girl, and a seductive, darker creature to perfection. From the opening scene it's clear that once again Aronofsky has made a visually stunning movie, so with that already shown... it's nice to see that the script was masterful too. The transition was incredible, the metaphors thick, and the music incredible. Such a great last scene too, with an ending kind of like The Wrestler. Maybe next he'll tackle baseball.

  <summary>We follow 24 hours in the life of a being (DL) moving from life to life like a cold and solitary assassin moving from hit to hit. In each of these interwoven lives, the being possesses an entirely distinct identity: sometimes a man, sometimes a woman, sometimes youthful, sometimes old to the point of dying; sometimes destitute, sometimes wealthy. By turns murderer, beggar, company chairman, monstrous creature, worker, family man… (mubi.com)</summary>
  <quote>One could enjoy this just based on the &quot;wtf&quot; that it makes you feel, but there are a lot of weird movies. Holy Motors has some incredible scenes, such as the rendition of Let My Baby Ride, or the ending (it made me laugh). That's the thing, for as odd as it is, and for how great the premise is, there is a point here (I don't entirely know what it is, I just know it's there, maaan). It uses music well, and the vignettes range from weird, to heart wrenching to violent... and it does it easily.</quote>

The story is told with fractured images and there are a lot of cool ideas like putting a coo-coo sound over the Mosfilms logo instead of heroic music. This is classic Tarkovsky.

The character development is not surprising and they progress in ways you'd expect, but I'd argue it doesn't matter. Different styles of comedy (vulgar, cheesy, clever) all work. What the movie focuses on it succeeds in and the church scene will go down as one of the best scenes of the year. Right now, this is the movie to beat this year, only a few have a chance.</quote>

It's a visually stunning fantasy movie in both animation and atmosphere, but what's most impressive is how you're watching it and you realize it's a pretty profound and beautiful look at memories and stories, made better by the fact that it's a dark, melancholy film that is basically for kids.

  <quote>A great reflection on privacy but also a good character study. It starts off pretty lighthearted, but then becomes more grave as it goes on. An excellent mystery movie that employs a lot of Hitchcock trademarks and his storytelling formula, but does so remarkably. Also, the direction is top notch, and the use of sound is extraordinary. Sound itself is really a character, which is so rare, the absence of it can be felt and things can be tense without a word really spoken. </quote>

  <quote>Brilliant. The music (especially that one drone-y song) just adds to the sense of overwhelming dread that is prevalent and suffocating throughout. Villeneuve lets the camera linger longer on a shot than most directors today, and he made Mexico a genuinely frightening character in itself, where you can't trust anything or anybody. Great performances around (especially my girl Blunt), with an intelligent script. Plus that abrupt ending... oh my god, yes.</quote>

There are times in SWs that the light sabre battles feel hollow but not the case here.

  <summary>Police officer Amadeus Warnebring was born into a musical family with a long history of famous musicians. He himself hates music. Now, Warnebring is about to face his worst case ever. A group of six eccentric drummers, led by revolutionary genius Sanna, has decided to launch a full-scale musical attack using the city - its buildings, its machinery, its ceaseless noise - as their instrument. (wff.pl)</summary>
  <quote>An incredible, original movie. I mean, I'm just a huge fan of this idea in general... I once tried to make music out of ordinary things (I failed), so this appeals to me. The musical sections are amazing (my favourite being Fuck the Music Kill! Kill!). True industrial music. Anyway, aside from the fantastic idea and the music, the plot itself is interesting. It's a musical cop movie, with some surrealism (the times of silence and whatnot), and it does it all so well.</quote>

Shaun is 12 and a bit of a loner, growing up with his mum in a grim coastal town, his dad killed fighting in the Falklands War. On his way home from school where he's been tormented all day for wearing flares, he runs into a group of skinheads, who against expectations turn out to be friendly and take him under their wing...

  <quote>First of all... what a fucking ending. A fantastic film in pretty much every way. You have a great cast all around, you have some really inspired and emotional music. You have subtle touches here and there that really flesh everything out, including the look at Far-Right Nationalism. I didn't expect this movie to make me as emotional as it did.</quote>

The internal logic and dialogue makes this very poetic, it builds a &quot;fantasy&quot; movie but it's more down to earth. There are no dragons (though there are beasts), but what makes it is the imagination of the world. This is the South like you've never seen.

  <quote>It could succeed on emotional response alone. Simply put, this movie crushed my soul properly. Besides that, you have a fantastically made movie with incredible cinematography that really enhances the general emotions of the film. Pitt is almost always incredible and of course Fincher is a great director and he shows it here. The CGI isn't just there to show off, as it blends in seemlessly. It's not a perfect film though, it does have a few scenes that feel odd, but who cares? It's sad as fuck.</quote>

This is disturbing, it builds and builds, and the visual style (the 'hand held' style that makes it look like real footage) is perfect for this.

Juxtaposed against his external composure are images of a woman and lights in distortion, with tension heightened by the sounds of power saws and a heartbeat.&quot; (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The audio here really puts this up on a high level. The images are okay, they're interesting at first. But it's the sound effects that really keep you intrigued while watching the distorted images on the screen.

The movie shifts once the superhero sections really get underway and sacrifices its humour (for the most part) for action and emotion.

  <quote>I usually really enjoy superhero movies these days, and I'm not ashamed. This is another Marvel movie, but the formula continues to work. There is some heart, and some great action, and the plot moves along at a brisk pace, but people who haven't seen other movies won't know what's going on. Superhero overload hasn't set in for me yet, so I appreciate what they've done here. Still engaging and exciting, even while lacking a sense of gravitas. Separate oneself from Civil War comics, however.</quote>

  <quote>This is sadder than District 9. While D9 was more socio-political, Chappie is more about social conditioning and what it's like to bring children into a scary world. Because of this, Chappie is an incredibly memorable character (I love his voice and how he talks), and there's a lot of depth here. Yo-Landi, Dev, and Ninja all do a great job, Jackman is expendable, but Copley is the star here as Chappie. Some of the tone shifts don't work.

  <quote>I have a bias towards experimental things so that helps explain the 90, but here's my justification: every now again there's a horror film that makes you feel like you've stumbled across something you shouldn't be seeing. This happens more with shorts, because it's harder to stretch that feeling out to a feature length, but this does it. No, I don't know what the fuck is going on, but the imagery worked. Also, the noise in the beginning portion is fantastic and terrifying, same with the end.</quote>

  <summary>Treachery is discovered amongst a traveling circus sideshow. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Awesome. I was most surprised by how invested I was in the characters. Browning could have just played it all for shock value (which, in '32 it woulda been shocking), but he didn't. There's real heart here, and the drama between them all is fascinating. That doesn't mean that there aren't some eerie parts though, like the chase in the rain at the end. To the credit of all involved, that tonal shift actually worked. </quote>

  <quote>Incredibly emotional piece. Some of it is a bit too much, too unsubtle and in your face (in a bad way), but that's a pretty minimal problem when you consider by the end I was so invested in what was going on that I had forgotten the bad. Great song playing during the credits, wonderful performance by Jordan, and the beginning (with the real footage) was a great way to start. Gritty, cruel, cold, unflinching, sentimental, all of these things describe this movie.</quote>

  <quote>I'm giving both the same ranking but they're sort of different. The first had more action and weirder boss battles and raised questions. This one doesn't have as much action and the couple bosses are more normal, but the story breathes more and tries to answer questions. It doesn't answer it fully which some critics noted but I like that it's sort of vague. Too often we're just gifted answers. Very entertained by these Wuxia/Saw/Sci-Fi/ hybrids.

The movie itself is 80s like Drive (but campier), with its style (especially later on) and badass synth soundtrack, but it's also compelling because it goes from a tense thriller, to a minor Sci-Fi government conspiracy movie, to a campy, slasher flick.

  <summary>A symbolic depiction of hell on Earth, set in the last days of the Warsaw uprising in 1944. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Drags you through war. Only complaint is that I couldn't really get into the characters so much (but still seeing the shit they go through is tough). The sewer part is easily the highlight... it's pretty scary and this is one of those films that want to make you feel above all else. Fuck conventional film making, this makes you feel claustrophobic because it's drenched in darkness.</quote>

  <quote>I really knew nothing about this but I'm glad I'm not the only person to think that it's a lot like Taxi Driver. That doesn't mean it's bad or unoriginal; it's just the tone is off in the same ways (in a good way). It's not really that funny, though it does have some decent jokes, but De Niro's performance is awesome and it's an unpredictable film; some of it is awkward and uncomfortable, but yet there is some sympathy here for the characters. </quote>

  <quote>Best X-Men movie since X2, but this is a different beast. It's a very personal tale that manages to touch on a view different relevant issues (like immigration obviously), while throwing in enough brutal Wolverine violence to be satisfying in that way as well. Stewart and Jackman are brilliant in their roles, as they always are, so I'd rather talk about how Keen is excellent; an actress who demonstrates acting ability well beyond her years. Also, yes, very sad, perfect ending too. The X cross!</quote>

  <quote>This movie is special. Gosling is hilarious, Crowe plays a wonderful (and violent) straight man, and the chemistry between them is undeniable. There are some great laughs here and coming out of the theatre I said that &quot;it had enough successful jokes to be a good comedy&quot; rather than only having a few and failing like so many, but even when it's not funny it's stylish and entertaining. Any flaws here are insignificant. </quote>

  <quote>Can you imagine this back in 1955? I think that back then it would be more shocking but that doesn't mean it can't make an impact even today, that's how good it is. The narration is pitch perfect in describing it, even though he says he basically can't describe it. That, along with the images of both past and -- at the time -- present, this is a really great documentary and should be necessary viewing in History courses. </quote>

  <quote>I like it more than the original because instead of a horror movie they just decided to make it a mixture of Escape from New York and The Warriors (in terms of there being different, silly groups of people). Because of this, it was a lot of fun. The social commentary is very heavy-handed and at one point perhaps a little too blunt, even for me, but at least it was there.

Sometimes I can't tell if Night is trying to be funny or his shit writing tendencies come out, much like in The Visit, but I can't even deny that I don't care cuz it's fun. He's always been a talented DIRECTOR but now he's regaining some prestige.</quote>

  <summary>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... Princess Leia (Fisher) is held hostage by the evil Imperial forces in their effort to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker (Hamill) and Captain Han Solo (Ford) team together with the lovable droid duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. (20th Century Fox)</summary>
  <quote>Great start to a classic series. Though I find Hamill to be the weakest link, everyone else does a great job, especially Ford who is charming as hell. Amazing model work, great usage of special effects, a fun story, wonderful music, visuals that still look good today. Because of the talent involved, the sometimes corny dialogue is still cool. Not much more you can say, there's a reason it's so highly regarded.</quote>

The final battle takes place on the moon of Endor, with its natural inhabitants, the Ewoks, lending a hand to the rebels. Will Darth Vader and the dark side overcome the rebels and take over the universe ? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Star Wars sometimes rides that line between a little childish and more mature and dark. Empire was mostly dark, but this does a little bit of both. While I don't think the more lighthearted parts, like Endor, are bad, they're not what Return does best. I almost rated it a 95 though because of the last little while with Luke and Vader... riveting stuff. Besides that, just another great sci-fi flick, same elements as the previous two in the original trilogy. This is my second fave. </quote>

  <quote>An improvement on the original because of more focus, less characters -- thus meaning more attention paid to the ones that exist -- and better violence. It's still a little confusing at times because there are still quite a few people, but you get the gist of it eventually. The violence is still incredibly gory and almost disgusting at times, and watching these alliances form and crumble is a treat. Chiba is incredible as an over-the-top killer who is a complete badass.</quote>

  <summary>Kinji Fukasaku's violent chronicle of mob warfare in post-war Hiroshima continues with this, the third film in the Yakuza Papers series. Shozo Hirono (Bunta Sugawara) struggles to remain independent and neutral in the midst of an ongoing battle between two mob families, but his drams of brokering a balance between them are dashed when a crime syndicate from Kobe enters the picture. (All Movie Guide)</summary>
  <quote>So far I've rated these pretty consistently, with the first being lower because it's ridiculously confusing for a while. I feel like I'm repeating but it is hard to follow this series because the lives of the Yakuza - with all their alliances, betrayals and people - is hard to follow. The movies move at a breakneck speed, are incredibly violent, but extremely fascinating. The quality doesn't really shift, and nothing (in terms of film making) changes from movie to movie, but Proxy War is great.</quote>

  <summary>A long-standing gang war on the streets of Hiroshima escalates despite police pressure in this, the fourth film in Kinji Fukasaku's Yakuza Papers series. It's 1964, and with the Tokyo Olympics turning the eyes of the world to Japan, lawmen have set out to keep the Yakuza -- Japan's organized crime system -- out of sight. (All Movie Guide)</summary>
  <quote>I've given every film a 90 except for the first, which got an 85, and there's good reason for that. Firstly, the quality is exceptional but secondly, these films don't change from one another very much. They start the same -- explaining what has happened -- and then end with something interesting that makes you want to watch the next. 4 actually has a bit more closure and emotion than the previous ones I felt, and the major conflict between police and Yakuza is thrilling.</quote>

  <quote>I couldn't help but compare it to Buried so my review will reflect that. This is more stylish and more emotional. I just felt a little more emotionally invested than I did Buried. Buried however, was more intense (because there were no scenes cutting away to help ease what you're watching). Franco also gives a great performance. This is flashier than Buried, with some great camera angles, and ultimately because of the happy ending, it's less gritty and depressing. So it depends on what you want.</quote>

I've never been an assassin (heh, heh) or anything, but I imagine this movie shows just how one would feel. Clooney is fantastic, his facial expressions tell so much.

  <summary>Four Lions is the tale of four British Islamic jihadists and their bungling plan to detonate a bomb during the London marathon. As things don't go to plan their differing ideological ideals clash and their plans turn to farce. A comedy with tragic overtones about ideologies, terrorism and idiots.</summary>

  <quote>It's obvious what the movie is directing its anger at.  If you're a cranky old man, and accept that this movie applies to everyone in some way (like either they hate you or you hate something they hate), then you'll have a great time. They tackle bigger issues about America and whatnot, but then they go after little things like obnoxious movie-goers. The first little while is amazing, and while it gets a little more conventional, it stays good. Excellent satire.</quote>

I have no arguments against it... the sand is a character and the movie looks beautiful and dark. The acting was also good, the soundtrack was right-on. Where I feel the movie stumbles a bit is how it tells its narrative. I found it tedious at times. However, there were times I was thrilled by it, and wanted to see more. I was entertained a lot more than I was bored, but still. </quote>

  <quote>It's not quite as funny as Hot Fuzz (very little is) and Shaun of the Dead but damn it was a good time. It worked as an apocalyptic action movie and obviously a comedy. The plot was pretty interesting though not really the reason I went anyway, and the social commentary was intriguing. It started off a little slow in terms of laughs and I felt like maybe they lost their edge, but as it went on I found myself consistently laughing. And that's all I wanted from the finale in this trilogy. </quote>

  <quote>In a movie like this, obviously you need two things: A great script and a great lead performance. This movie has both. It also makes you feel for Paul, and is the most claustrophobic movie I've ever seen I think. In the vein of the first Saw (though different), where a really simple concept can be executed to perfection. I enjoyed the political content... yeah, it wasn't subtle but I don't feel like enough people think about it anyway. </quote>

There is emotional depth here, and the element of &quot;who's telling the truth?&quot; is appealing.</quote>

However... awesome ending, Danny McBride was the star (especially when he was introduced, I watched that scene twice), great music choices, and this should get props just for the self-referential premise, which makes it intriguing, and they pulled it off well. Not quite as good as Worlds End, but close.</quote>

  <quote>Very good futuristic short, worthy of the attention it's getting and the feature length treatment it will be getting as well. The visuals are astounding, the effects are truly awe-inspiring. The premise is cool too... an augmented reality where people get robot parts in order to live forever, thus making us no longer natural or organic. The short moves along well, describing the world and ending in a fitting way. Can't wait to see the feature length.</quote>

  <summary>A concise look at some of the more bizarre visual aspects of The Shining. Through interviews with collaborators, current filmmakers and authors, we'll examine how Kubrick used his unique brand of visual storytelling to convey madness, evil, and the power of the supernatural without relying on dialog or conventional exposition. As much as any film he ever made, The Shining illustrates Kubrick's talent for using the language of pure cinema to tell his stories. (imdb)</summary>

  <quote>A great, moody (the music and cinematography really set a great tone here) look at a crime family. Great acting, and the tension builds and builds until it hits an abrupt -- but memorable -- ending, making this a very affective movie.</quote>

  <summary>On the night of the discovery of a duplicate planet in the solar system, an ambitious young student and an accomplished composer cross paths in a tragic accident. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The strengths of this are a neat idea of a duplicate Earth (fuck logic -- it's used to examine guilt and redemption and whatnot), a strong performance by Brit Marling, and pretty solid music. It also has a wonderful little ending shot to tie it all up. The drama is handled well. It was never boring.</quote>

  <quote>It's a step back from the previous two movies, especially Guardians, and it's smaller (HA THE PUNS, OMG) in scale, but after a slow and shaky start, it becomes really funny and the action takes advantage of the big/small dynamic in order to craft some of the better fight scenes in the MCU.

It's nice to see him take on a big issue, and he handles it with subtlety and finesse. Everything gels, from the tight script which is smart (yet comedic at times), to the actors (including himself). It moves along at a good pace. It doesn't hit me emotionally like GBG, but I was still involved.</quote>

  <quote>It gets action right, definitely. Ultimately that's basically what it wants to do. The script falters a bit with try-hard dialogue that sometimes is just corny but that's definitely forgivable. I actually enjoyed watching The Avengers fight each other quite a bit but the last part is equally as satisfying. Why people expect more from this is mind boggling. It'd be nice to have some emotional depth, because it would lift this to a 90, but that's not what it wanted or tried to do. It's pure action</quote>

  <summary>A coming of age comedy/drama for the post hip hop generation. Malcolm is a geek, carefully surviving life in The Bottoms, a tough neighborhood in Inglewood, CA filled gangsters and drugs dealers, while juggling his senior year of college applications, interviews and the SAT. His dream is to attend Harvard. A chance invitation to a big underground party leads Malcolm and his friends into a, only in Los Angeles, gritty adventure filed with offbeat characters and bad choices. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Admittedly it stops being funny a little ways through (though up until that point I laughed quite a bit), and only occasionally sprinkles laughs into the mix as it transforms into a drama. I just love rap as a soundtrack for movies, and even a scene with a Korn song was awesome. In fact, it's a perfect marriage of music and visuals throughout. Tonally all over the place, but it's a lot of fun to watch because it's so energetic; a compelling and dynamic experience w/o becoming a mess.</quote>

  <quote>Take my critic card away if you want, but I really enjoyed it. I just found it funny and clever, ultimately, and it subverted conventions in meaningful and entertaining ways. The chemistry between Whitman and Amell was really good and helped it a lot, and while it does go to a place you'd expect... it was a fun journey. I'm very surprised by this because I expected to hate it, as the trailers were terrible.</quote>

  <summary>A story centered on contract worker who is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group, only to find herself falling for its leader (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The thing is, it's hard to examine this issue in a movie, especially a fiction one, because it's not simple. The East does a great job of trying though. I understand anarchism so most movies frustrate me with how they portray anarchists. They do a decent job here. It clearly targets corporate America so in that way yes it is slanted, but that's okay, especially if you agree. Ultimately it's a good political thriller that's as human as it can be, it's tense and exciting, and makes people think.</quote>

The visuals are like a drug-induced haze, which makes sense, and it all feels so dreamy it's hard not to feel at least a little captivated by it all. I'll probably  never watch it twice though.

  <summary>Documentary that chronicles how Francis Ford Coppola&amp;amp;#039;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; was plagued by extraordinary script, shooting, budget, and casting problems--nearly destroying the life and career of the celebrated director. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote> documentary about Apocalypse Now. It's informative and interesting. It's amazing that the movie got made at all but it's still fascinating to see how personal the movie was to FFC, how he embodied the movie's themes and concepts.</quote>

  <quote>Sometimes this feels like a good Coens brother movie. It was a lot funnier than I anticipated, the drama was good enough, and the atmosphere was splendid. It was bolstered by a good soundtrack and a plot that may not have been original, but was certainly well told. I hadn't heard of this film until yesterday but I'm glad I checked it out because it's a great Western crime heist flick.</quote>

  <summary>Clint Eastwood directs this supernatural thriller about three very different people and their responses to death, including a hesitant American psychic named George (Matt Damon) who may be able to help the others find answers and peace. Marie (Cécile De France) is a French journalist caught up in the aftereffects of the devastating 2004 tsunami, while in London, young Marcus (Frankie McLaren) seeks to contact his deceased twin brother.</summary>
  <quote>It uses its slow, deliberate pace to tell a story much like -- as someone else said -- Babel does, only I liked this more than I liked Babel. 2 of the 3 stories really fascinated me, but the one with Marie I wasn't real thrilled about (except for the amazing beginning). It doesn't offer a lot of solace, or answers, by the end but it leaves you wondering, and basking in the beauty of what you've just seen.</quote>

He takes a room and decides to stay. Meanwhile, a group of outlaws are about to return to the town and take their revenge - will the towns leaders convince the mysterious man to help? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>What prevents this from being amazing is just that it's slow at the beginning and a little derivative. Eastwood's character is impossible to like but when the movie ends you realize that's kind of the point: as others have noted, it's both surreal and a horror western. The plot twist is obvious, but since it's a ghost revenge tale, it makes sense that he's an unflinching bastard with a singular purpose. I also love the eerie choice of music that plays occasionally. Excellent cinematography.</quote>

They could have covered the topics it tries to address a little more and the actual Hunger Games wasn't as brutal as it should have been, and yes it ends up being very Hollywood and I hope it doesn't end up being Twilight-ish... but you know, I was into this a lot. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Dystopias and Lawrence, but the movie was kind of gritty and entertaining. Camera work was annoying at times though.</quote>

  <summary>The wife of marshal Matt Morgan is raped and murdered. The killers leave behind a distinctive saddle, that Morgan recognises as belonging to his old friend Craig Belden, now cattle baron in the town of Gun Hill. Belden is sympathetic, until it transpires that one of the murderers is his own son Rick, whom he refuses to hand over... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Yeah, it does pretty much the same thing a lot of westerns do but Belden and Morgan have a very convincing friendship and seeing the exchanges between the two characters was great. The woman was lame but then if I didn't seperate myself from that in a lot of westerns I'd probably hate the genre. I thought that the movie was pretty tense and suspenseful most of the time, and we got a great draw at the end (though that's to be expected).</quote>

  <summary>Trevor is a 16 year old, sometimes-violent skinhead with no regard for authority, and would rather spend his time stealing cars than sitting in the detention centre to which he is sent. His social worker, Harry Parker, tries to do his best, but Trevor is only interested when there&amp;amp;#039;s something that he can get out of it. The authorities within the centre try to make Trevor conform to the norms of society, but he takes no notice, and would rather speak in a torrent of four-letter words and racial abuse.

  <quote>This examines the situation extremely well. You got this smart, but ultimately misguided teen and he's stuck in these facilities to try to correct him. The anti-establishment shit he spews is sometimes so spot-on, but yet he's still ultimately a completely racist dick. It shows the character as gray, and there's a great performance by Roth to bring him alive. It's a gritty, intelligent movie, that doesn't go far, but it makes logical sense.</quote>

  <quote>It's Ritchie being Ritchie and that's really all I want. Easily his best movie in years; a compelling and funny spy movie in a year that already has a bunch of those. I have to give special attention to the soundtrack and the casting. Cavill, Hammer and Vikander all have an &quot;old movie&quot; timeless quality to them in different ways. Sometimes shots go on too long, occasionally without a proper payoff but that's a minor gripe. Story isn't amazing but its good, faults covered by the humor and cast.</quote>

This is interesting and well done because sometimes victims of abuse are like that. It becomes ingrained in them.

Maybe it's because there are some odd moments, like when loud sounds/music plays over important scenes where it is not needed, and detracts from it.

  <summary>Julian, a drug-smuggler thriving in Bangkok's criminal underworld, sees his life get even more complicated when his mother compels him to find and kill whoever is responsible for his brother's recent death. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I'm not getting the hate. Movies CAN be &quot;style over substance&quot; and that's okay. A nice stylish film is good once in a while, and this excels at that. The lighting, the little dialogue, the way it drifts from scene to scene... it all works. I think this is more symbolic than literal, so yes the plot isn't amazing in that sense but I feel there's more to it. It was just fun to watch because it did things its own way. Plus I love the fight scene between Gosling and the cop, love the music and mood.</quote>

  <summary>When Rodney Baze mysteriously disappears and law enforcement fails to follow through, his older brother, Russell, takes matters into his own hands to find justice. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Liked this quite a bit more than a lot of others I'm gathering, but to me it was a nice, slow-paced emotional crime drama, with excellent cinematography, acting and music. Sure, it's not like it's original, but it's done quite well, and the ultimate revenge felt satisfying, due largely in part to Bale being such a good actor. I was interested the entire time and it never felt cheesy.</quote>

  <quote>It gets set up like a really eerie stalker tale, with some genuinely creepy moments... but it's still relatively normal at that point. And then it becomes complete mindfuckery, blurring all kinds of lines. I love how the movie truly plays with the audience just as much as the characters are played with, and it becomes incredibly engrossing. There are a few cheesy moments and conventions present that knock it down a bit, but this is still a great film.</quote>

The scene where it was revealed who killed Danny was understated but really moving. I guess that's where this movie delivers... heavy subject matter in a subtle way</quote>

  <summary>In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off most life on the planet, a class system evolves aboard the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe via a perpetual-motion engine. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Snowpiercer is pretty heavy-handed in its approach but I'm not criticizing it for that. This is very much a poor vs rich movie, with religious undertones (the engine is sacred). But it is beautifully shot and really does a good job of representing all classes both physically and with good writing. I'm very much down with a class warfare movie, always, and everyone fires on all cylinders for this one. Even Evans, who I don't think is amazing as a whole, does well here. </quote>

  <summary>Duncan, an introverted 14-year-old, comes into his own over the course of a comedic summer when he forms unlikely friendships with the gregarious manager of a rundown water park and the misfits who work there. (sundance.org)</summary>
  <quote>The themes and set-up are so familiar that it almost feels like I've seen the movie before, sometimes. But despite that, it rises above a lot of other coming of age tales. With great performances all across the board, with an especially believable one by Liam James in the lead and Sam Rockwell who plays a lovable goof, The Way, Way Back explores territory that isn't original... but does it in such a way that it's funny and heart-warming. Try not to get a little choked up at some point during it.</quote>

  <quote>Seems to be a lot of Anon stuff coming, this and the book We Are Anonymous, both this year. Anyway: Anon and 4chan is just fascinating by itself, as it leaves a lot to discuss just by existing, but where the movie shines is the fact that while it's obviously pro-Anon, it's pretty self-critical in the same way. Being this way allows it to show what it is, and why it's both good and bad in the grand scheme of things. It'd be worse if the whole thing was just YEAH WE FUCKIN' ROCK WE DID THIS!</quote>

The first little while was really funny and well written, then there's this awkward transition period where it went from comedy to drama, and I felt it fell off a bit and didn't transition fluidly, but then it ended in a good way, so it regained its footing. Also, it's nice to see a movie use wrestling as its backdrop. Touching movie.</quote>

The duo works together to stop a powerful adversary that threatens mankind, but their ideological differences drive them apart and turn them into ferocious enemies.</summary>
  <quote>Let's not kid ourselves, you're probably watching the movie because you want to see how the friendship between X and Magneto got fucked up... at least if you know anything about them or X-Men. The movie succeeds on that front. Their friendship is done well, and heart breaking, lead by good performances from the two leads. Because of this, it's easier to forgive the cast of mutants (though I understand not having the best from the get go), and the spotty acting some of the other people give.</quote>

Shozo Hirono (Bunta Sugawara) is a former Japanese soldier who, following his nation's defeat in World War II, finds himself in a prison cell in Hiroshima on a murder charge. While behind bars, Hirono gains a loyal friend in fellow criminal Wagasugi (Tatsuo Umemiya), and upon his release Hirono joins Wagasugi in an underworld gang. What starts as a seemingly easy way to earn some quick money becomes something darker and bloodier... (All Movie Guide)</summary>
  <quote>I got Yakuza bias because I'm fascinated by them, and I'm looking forward to watching the other movies in the series. Crazy violent, but not without a sense of (dark) humour. It's hard to follow, especially at the beginning when a lot of people are introduced, but it straightens itself out somewhat. The scheming, the betrayals and the murder are all intriguing, bolstered by an incredible score. It makes room for the sequel, but still ends with a degree of closure (not a bullshit ending).</quote>

His cross-town journey becomes an almost vertical voyage, with bizarre occurrences and an authentic parade of crazy characters along the way, in a landscape that depicts the modern soul of the West at the end of the millennium (mubi.com)</summary>
  <quote>It's a pretty cold and detached film, with the general feel and the dialogue, which is unnatural at times, literary and symbolic. I think that in this particular type of movie, that works. I was never going to feel bad for the main character due to political reasons. However, the movie knows this I reckon, and somehow draws you into its world, and is interesting the entire time, with a nice ending. Cronenberg is a talented director who pieced this dense film together wonderfully.</quote>

  <quote>I think CatrelS sums up my feelings here but I'll add a bit more. It's a pretty &quot;out there&quot; idea and while it doesn't always stick, it's still daring and we should appreciate movies like this. It was ambitious. The score was great, the Meanwhile City parts were better than the normal world and while some of it was wonky, it's a good flick. Flesh out the themes and characters a little more, work on the pacing a bit and it would have been a 85-90.</quote>

  <summary>Based on legendary science-fiction author Philip K. Dick's own experiences, A Scanner Darkly tells the darkly comedic, caustic, but deeply tragic tale of drug use in the modern world.  The film plays like a graphic novel come to life with live-action photography overlaid with an advanced animation process -- a method known as interpolated rotoscoping, first employed in writer/director Richard Linklater's 2001 film &quot;Waking Life&quot; -- to create a haunting version of America, seven years from now.

  <summary>When a teen murders his math teacher in the name of a black metal band, the mid 30s lead singer will have to re-evaluate the two things he loves most, his music and his family. Black Metal, a dark drama, follows Ian, a husband, father and musician struggling with the guilt and blame of a tragic and senseless murder. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Definitely a very effective short. It's quite something to think about, how an artist who makes aggressive, loud music must feel after a fan commits a violent act. Even today this kind of thing gets blamed even though for most people it's a relatively peaceful (except maybe at shows, but that's a different story) outlet for their feelings. This short handles its heavy subject matter with finesse, and the lead actor does a good job portraying the different emotions and guilt that he feels.</quote>

  <quote>The acting, cinematography, script, direction, sound effects/mixing -- everything about this movie is great except one thing: the music.

Still manages to be a deeply emotional film, but how awkward the tone could get at time felt at odds with what it's doing. Change the music and you got yourself a 90.</quote>

Tully tries to pass his wisdom on to Ernie (Jeff Bridges), his 18-year-old protégé, attempting to give the kid the chances he missed.</summary>
  <quote>Very gritty and realistic, with great performances by Bridges and Keach. The ending was great and subtle; a perfect reflection on what transpired over the course of the film. It's probably what made me put it over to an 80. The character arcs could have used a little more fleshing out, but besides that, the script is well done. Though Trully and Ernie only interact once in a while, the movie is stronger because it showcases the different paths. When the ending comes it's more poignant that way.</quote>

  <quote>It isn't the funniest (though it has a few really good gags) and it's definitely not the scariest, but somehow this film escapes the typical confines of comedic horror movies and ends up being genuinely touching. It's a nice satire of the slasher flick, but the real star is the emotional bond between Max and her mom, along with the visual flair that accompanies it. 80s is in, and it isn't top of its class, but the use of colours is beautiful... great cinematography.</quote>

  <quote>More of the same from Pixar, which isn't an insult at all. It's got fantastic animation and I agree with whoever said that the water animation is incredible. I didn't find it as funny or as touching as some of the other Pixar movies, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have funny or touching moments because the end got to me a bit and the biggest laugh for me was a fart joke. But the laughs are too few and far between... seems more forced than a movie like Up. Still great stuff as a whole, though.</quote>

  <quote>I'm gonna be one of the few I guess that sticks up for this movie because I thought it was quite funny. It was about on par with the first, and though sometimes it becomes a little too vulgar for its own good (and thus briefly stops being funny), I still laughed quite a bit throughout. A movie can stick to a formula and still be entertaining.</quote>

  <quote>I'll give it an 80 to mean I think it's &quot;great&quot; but I'm a little disappointed. The acting is wooden at times, but I love the excellent soundtrack by Disasterpeace, which makes it feel retro and creep. I also love that the movie is different than most others. The pool scene fell a little flat. It had great cinematography and maintained a sense of dread throughout, but it wasn't cripplingly so... which is a problem 'cuz I think the premise might be better than the execution. Shoulda been scarier.</quote>

When Mickey finally lands a big case, it has deadly consequences. Tasked with defending rich lothario Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), who's been charged with assault, Mickey finds himself and his family in danger when he deduces that the sinister Louis may be guilty.</summary>
  <quote>It succeeds on everything it needs to, but doesn't offer anything original to the formula. Who's complaining though? This is a great flick. It has a well written script, and a great performance by McConaughey, who isn't really known for giving great performances. He's charming and, well, was born to play this role. This translates to a thrilling courtroom drama with enough twists and turns to interest anybody.</quote>

  <summary>On the most challenging day of his illustrious career, Ivan Locke receives an unexpected phone call, gets behind the wheel and starts to drive. To stop from unravelling his job, his family and essentially his life, Locke will need to drive all night and compete against time.</summary>
  <quote>Movies like Phone Booth and Buried used a similar setup where their self-mandated limitations forced them to come up with an intriguing plot/story. They were thrillers about people forced to deal with extraordinary circumstances. Locke is different... it's about a guy driving to London having normal conversations (compared to those other movies). It's interesting watching Hardy give a great performance as a guy whose life is unravelling. It's very human and well-written.</quote>

  <quote>Nichols is incredible, and the performances by Edgerton and Negga are unstated by effective. In fact, the entire movie refuses to go huge; too often, these types of films do that but here the intimacy and love of the marriage shines through. There are moments where it's a little boring, and that keeps it from reaching higher heights. Now, this is Nichols' worst film so far but I still rate it an 80 because while I quite enjoyed it, I'm not LOVING it. Also, way to sneak Shannon in there again.</quote>

It quickly develops into a meditation on the human and environmental costs of the permanent and profound changes our planet is experiencing. Focusing on Burtynsky's images of China as it undergoes an unprecedented transformation into a 21st century powerhouse, the film's surface is beautiful, its implications frightening.

  <quote>I'm on the fence about whether I give it that extra point to make it a &quot;great&quot; movie. Fuck it, I'll do it. It's got absolutely great images, and shows just how photography can morph anything into something beautiful. While those are a joy to look at, I found myself zoning out once in a while. Seeing the portfolio might be more beneficial because then you can examine the pics without having to pause the movie.

  <summary>A highly styled 'genre' film which can perhaps be seen as a pastiche of all gangster movies. Tom Reagan is the laconic anti-hero of this amoral tale which is also, paradoxically, a look at morals within the criminal underworld of the 1930s. Two rival gangs vie for control of a city where the police are pawns, and the periodic busts of illicit drinking establishments are no more than a way for one gang to get back at the other. Black humour and shocking violence compete for screen time as we question whether or not Tom, right-hand man of the Irish mob leader, really has a heart. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The only thing that I can see wrong with Miller's Crossing is that there's a cold detachment that makes it hard to really care. I think that's present in a bunch of their movies, and that's why my opinion is sometimes middling with their movies. But this is interesting enough, with some great dialogue, and some beautifully shot scenes. Definitely worth a watch, but not especially brilliant by any means.</quote>

  <quote>This was pretty great. It didn't have anything to push it over to make me go WOW, but it was really solid the entire way through, with good acting, a good story. It was nice to see how this thriller would pan out. Didn't have to rely on action or anything, just a solid story.</quote>

  <summary>An absurdist, surrealistic and shocking pitch-black comedy, which moves freely from nightmare to fantasy to hilariously deadpan humour as it muses on man’s perpetual inhumanity to man. (tmdb.com)</summary>
  <quote>Can be a little slow at times, but the awkward acting is great. People look and act bored because that's the point. The use of static camera won't appeal to all but that's Andersson's trademark. Clever tragicomedy on display here, with the King being the highlight of the film. One of the final scenes is pretty depressing as well. It shifts tones whenever it feels like it.</quote>

  <quote>Some of the acting is a tad sub-par, but for the most part I like it. Time travel and dystopias, good enough for me. The world that plurality builds is pretty much purposely characterless (thus actually giving it character in context) and it does well. Good visual design. The cliff hanger ending wasn't totally unexpected but it excites me to see what's going to happen.</quote>

  <quote>I quite enjoyed this. The first half or so is an interesting drama, before the time travel even gets introduced. The second half left me guessing because I had never read the short story that it is based on. As always, with time travel movies, there is only so much logic you can apply here, and inevitably people will rip holes in it, but it was thrilling. Snook was wonderful in this as well.</quote>

The &quot;found footage&quot; way in which it was filmed actually heightens the intimacy of it, and it is more focused on the relationships of the teens than anything else. It doesn't have any breakout stars, and could shorten certain scenes, but it's solid film making. In my eyes, judging from the way it has been received so far, it will go down as an underrated movie.</quote>

  <quote>Sides with the Left, but I don't think it's that far-fetched. People do talk like this, even now. It's a lot of info to put into an hour and a half, meaning you can't go into the kind of detail that would justify either side, really. Pretty gritty movie with good acting, I believe it can encourage conversation, though it won't break any stereotypes so in that sense it could set it back a bit. Still, it's a starting point.

  <quote>It's one of the strangest looks at puberty I think. I'm not entirely sure if the idea of puberty scaring him and adults being hideous monsters really connect like the creator of the short wanted because puberty doesn't make an adult (it's part of it though, obviously). Could have just chosen the adult fear. BUT I still really enjoyed this short because of the imagery.

But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone... (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I guess I'm just not huge into Scorsese. I rarely connect with his movies like others seem to. I can't knock him really. I can't knock De Niro in this.

  <quote>Unfortunately, SS is a movie that can't maintain what made it fantastic in the first half or so, maybe more. God damn this had a lot of charm and some really great jokes, along with some wonderful songs like Drive It Like You Stole It. And then it becomes a typical tale, but that's not even my problem: it becomes ridiculously cheesy to the point of hammy, and because of that the ending felt like a C movie. It tried to undo good will that it built. I do love Reynor as brother Brendan. </quote>

  <quote>Though I get sick of the premise (people move into house, get haunted), I felt like Sinister handled it well. It built a good story about a true-crime novelist, and it even raised questions about the idea of whether he's doing it for fame or to battle injustice, which I appreciated. It was sufficiently creepy and disturbing, with great Super 8 short films that were easily the best part. A wonderful blend of original music and great bands, and the movie didn't rely on gore. Pleasantly surprised.</quote>

I admire the movie for exploring a serious issue in a ballsy way, the movie not settling for white and black, but instead a grey area. Biel was wonderful in this too. I didn't expect the movie I got. I THOUGHT IT'D BE A DOCU ABOUT SLENDER MAN (kidding... or am I?)</quote>

  <quote>I'm going to go against a lot of people here, but I don't see what's so terribly wrong about this movie. Yes, the writing is pretty messy (though the plot itself is only generic, not bad), with some plot holes that should have been fixed but don't ruin the movie. Is solid writing really the focus on a movie like this? It has GREAT over-the-top action, some emotion, good visuals, and it was quite funny, with only a few cheesy moments. It was a thrill ride with characters I love.</quote>

First of all, the movie plays perfectly on a very common fear of the dark, and makes a creepy thriller with only two big jump scares, which are made more amazing due to the fact there aren't 80 of them. I think, even though most of the movie is pretty dark, that there are actually some good images (like when the shadow people show up, for example). I also like that nothing is explained.

I feel like some of the flow of the movie was wonky but great performances all around. Umay is a really compelling character. As someone on IMDB said, &quot;a hero in the best sense of the word.&quot; Also: a great, realistic world about human rights and family. It's sickening watching some of these people, but then you know it's very true.</quote>

  <quote>I got away from Solondz after Palindromes, but this is about more of the same. He's an imaginative director, and Wiener-Dog is a pretty funny comedy. Mostly it's just awkward (like the rest of his stuff that I've seen), but there were parts that made me laugh. It does come across sometimes like he's just making characters to mock them, and I would never say there's any real drama here, but it's an entertaining watch with occasional brilliant moments and good, understated cinematography.</quote>

  <quote>No one is going to agree everything on the list, so to rank it based on that is silly. Does the movie do a good job of talking about and justifying their choices? Does it make you miss those rivalries? The answer to both of those questions is &quot;yes,&quot; and that's why it succeeds and is worth a watch.</quote>

  <quote>I like it, I think it's interesting and original. There is actually a laugh or two, but it's mostly due to the fact that the director is trying to get birds to do what he wants, or clocks, etc. I saw people saying it's about if life imitates art or the other way around... also about the frustration of artists when things don't go exactly as they wish (uncontrollable happenings). So in this way, the short works, but be warned... it's 12 minutes of a guy telling people what to do.</quote>

  <summary>In Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s charming directorial debut, a selfish modern-day Don Juan attempts to change his ways. (sundance.org)</summary>
  <quote>I don't think it quite hits the &quot;great&quot; mark for me. I think it's a bold directorial debut, taking the subject of a sex (more specifically porn) addict guido and making a rom-com out of it. Everyone does well, and the lead characters are interesting enough. It was funny at times, but my issue is that it doesn't reach far beyond &quot;interesting enough&quot; or &quot;good enough.&quot; It's not hilarious but has a few great gags, the drama is good but not OVERLY memorable. But props for tackling porn head on.</quote>

  <summary>A lonely middle-aged catering manager (Bob Hoskins) spends all of his time studying tapes of an eccentric TV chef (Arsinee Khanjian). Meanwhile, a young woman (Elaine Cassidy) is making her way from Ireland to find her boy friend (Peter McDonald), who moved to England to get a job in a lawn-mower factory. On arrival, she makes an early contact with the caterer, who recommends a boarding room to her. Slowly, it is revealed that the caterer has in fact befriended and subsequently abused more than a dozen young women. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Even though I enjoyed Hoskins and Cassidy, the music and some of the character building, I felt it was paced way way too slowly which put me off a bit. I won't deny that it builds a pretty interesting profile of a serial killer and the ending isn't what you'd expect. He really does show off how disturbed this guy is, while making him completely human.</quote>

  <quote>The first half was very well done. It was creepy, oozed atmosphere, etc. The second half I still liked but not quite as much. I enjoyed that they took it in a different route (sort of) by going into The Further, and I liked that there was a story about astral projection because every other movie explains hauntings differently (and generically). Feeling a bit different than a lot of horrors, just like Saw 1 did, this movie rarely falls to stupid cheap scares, and uses its elements wisely.</quote>

I was actually sort of connected to the Rambler due to his &quot;relationship&quot; with the girl who keeps dying. Sometimes music is used well, offering an interesting contrast between the weirdness and something more upbeat.</quote>

  <summary>A riveting thriller set in the drug underworld of the UK.</summary>
  <quote>Very Gut Ritchie-like, with a strong performance by Daniel Craig. This movie moves along at a good pace, with some interesting twists and turns along the way. Also; the ending is abrupt and awesome. Some of the musical choices didn't work for me though. Stylish and fun, watch it.</quote>

(Samuel Goldwyn Films)</summary>
  <quote>How do I approach this? It's a mess, it's really calculated. It depends on whether you agree with &quot;a movie pretending to be bad is good&quot; or not. It definitely has tons to say and for that, good job Kelly, but a lot of people will be and have been turned off by this. From a narrative standpoint, it's a disaster, but maybe that's the point. Everytime I want to hate an aspect of it, I wonder if it's intentional. Frustrating, maybe great, maybe shit, but I'm giving it an 77 regardless. Might change.</quote>

I definitely get a theme of conformity. It's true that the production values are less than stellar but there are some genuinely disturbing scenes and just trying to figure out the puzzle (ha!) is fun in itself.

When he embraced the surrealism I was more intrigued because the movie didn't hit me on an emotional level.

  <summary>Generally unheralded at the time, the early 1980s hardcore punk rock scene gave birth to much of the rock music and culture that followed. Hardcore was more than music -- it was a social movement created by Reagan-era misfit kids. The participants constituted a tribe unto themselves -- some finding a voiced, others an escape in the hard-edged music. Ans while some sought a better world, others were just angry and wanted to raise hell. American Hardcore traces this lost subculture, from its early roots in 1980 to its initial flameout in 1986.

  <summary>Two Irish brothers accidentally killed mafia thugs. They turned themselves in and were released as heroes. They then see it as a calling by God and started knocking off mafia gang members one by one. Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks the brothers are doing the right thing. (imdb)</summary>

  <summary>Born Villain is a short film directed by actor Shia LaBeouf in collaboration with Marilyn Manson. It was released on August 28, 2011, during its inaugural screening, at the L.A. Silent Theater. Produced as an accompaniment to Marilyn Manson's eighth studio album, the film was intended as the record's promotional &amp;amp;quot;trailer&amp;amp;quot;. (Youtube)</summary>
  <quote>A mixture of Manson and Jodorowsky, clearly. While this doesn't really help lend Labeouf his own identity (just like Maniac didn't), it's still well done. It has odd, disturbing imagery, and it really isn't clear what's going on. Not really a fan of the Manson song... he's pretty much past his &amp;amp;quot;prime.&amp;amp;quot; But the video was well done and Shia's directed stuff seems more out there than the stuff he acts in, not that he isn't in some stuff with interesting ideas.</quote>

  <summary>The film tells a story of a divorced couple (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) trying to raise their young son. The story follows the boy for twelve years, from first grade at age 6 through 12th grade at age 17-18, and examines his relationship with his parents as he grows. (Tmdb)</summary>
  <quote>I thought I might absolutely love this because the opening scene, with Yellow, was profound to me for some reason. But as it went on, I started to realize I would merely like it. Which isn't bad by any means because I enjoyed myself, but it didn't grab me like it could have and didn't make me feel as emotional as it should have. However, great direction, the &quot;gimmick&quot; of filming these people over 12 years is interesting, and it's impressive that it didn't lose control of itself.</quote>

  <quote>Does what it sets out to do. Talks about Napster and gives insight into what took place during that time. Spends a little bit of time on the &quot;other side&quot; that opposed downloading, but seems mostly pro-downloading. Which is fine, I&quot;m just throwing that out there so people realize it.</quote>

It's a quirky -- though sometimes seemingly just to be quirky -- and oddball movie, but I didn't find it overly funny or dramatic.

  <summary>A documentary that chronicles Katy Perry's life on and off-stage.</summary>
  <quote>I actually like Katy, I think her image is interesting and most of the songs I've heard I like. Sometimes it feels very fluffy... like too staged, but then other stuff comes off as genuine. Plus, this is a classic tale of a struggling artist who goes on and accomplishes her dreams while having some personal problems; this stuff usually draws a person in. It helps that Katy Perry actually seems inspired and has a real vision, unlike a lot of pop stars. Now I'm gonna listen to her music..</quote>

  <quote>It's a nice little twist on Phone Booth. It was well put together, and the acting was solid. Builds tension about as well as it could, but really I'm not sure the premise of &amp;amp;quot;answer movie trivia&amp;amp;quot; was so great. A little silly, but despite that it's done well. There is no real deeper meaning here, but we on Criticker are all critics to some degree so it's nice to watch with that in mind. Solid flick.</quote>

  <quote>I don't think that it really lives up to the plot summary because in the idea of personal desires vs solidarity and tolerance, it's pretty thin. It touches on it but it was really more of a story about Emma, Erik and Anna and their triangle (if you can call it that), with everyone else as shallow characters meant to occasionally provide some insight/commentary into the triangle. But I still dug it and was impacted by the emotion and the great performance by Trine Dyrholm. </quote>

It does a good job of keeping you guessing whether her friends are good or bad, the ending was kind of meh, but the performances were good, especially by Juno Temple.

  <summary>After experiencing what they think are a series of &quot;break-ins&quot;, a family sets up security cameras around their home, only to realize that the events unfolding before them are more sinister than they seem.</summary>
  <quote>The bottom line is that it's lesser than the first in almost every way. I felt the pacing wasn't as good (I appreciated the slow build in the first), and while there were some really good scares, it felt cheaper than the first. I was more invested in the characters this time around. It's still a good movie, for the same reasons as the first but to a lesser extent, though it suffers from lacking the mystery of the first and being redundant. </quote>

  <summary>John Skillpa, a quiet bank clerk living in tiny Peacock, Nebraska, prefers to live an invisible life. This might have to do with John's secret: he has another personality no one knows about, a woman who each morning does his chores and cooks him breakfast before he starts his day. Then, in a moment, everything changes.</summary>
  <quote>It's not a must see, but it has some good performances and an interesting enough story, though it should have went into maybe a little more detail to flesh out the characters a bit more. But I'm sure some people will appreciate it more for the reason I'm knockin' it down a few points.</quote>

  <quote>I liked it but it isn't &quot;great.&quot; Bogart showed why he would go on to be such a big start in a rugged performance but it's not really the breakout role that it is seen as now. Howard is the star here. The script is fine and snappy enough to keep me interested, but the movie lacks depth in a visual sense. The direction is just bog standard in all ways, never offering up compelling shots. It's also predictable, though it may not have been so long ago... but I'm not bothered by that. A good time.</quote>

  <quote>I hope there's a part 2. I'm assuming the budget was small, so the special effects were done well. I was hesitant to watch cuz I saw &quot;nazi zombies&quot; and they're overdone but there's more to this than just that. The acting was fine, the Sci-Fi elements were implemented well, and the movie maintained a sense of intrigue throughout the 15 or so mins. The battle in the field left a little to be desired, but all-in-all, the grainy, muted colors add a great sense of atmosphere to this Sci-Fi </quote>

  <quote>Suffered from some of the things that plagued Miami Vice, though not to that extreme (I'm talking of some awkward edits). The DV mostly works but there are a couple shots where it sticks out like a sore thumb. But the movie generally entertains, has some interesting gunfights (but somewhat repetitive), has great acting from Depp especially, and looks absolutely beautiful most of the time. Some scenes, like the chase in the forest have amazing cinematography.</quote>

  <quote>I feel like it mostly makes you  have sympathy for the rich people. I think Jackie in particular is the most interesting. David really gets no sympathy from me. I don't know if that's the movie's fault or just my own personal values. Aside from that, it does a good job of depicting a riches to rags (as David said) type of story. Lauren tried but with these kinds of subjects, it's hard to ignore the class hatred or envy (whatever you feel) and truly care. Valiant effort though.</quote>

DiCaprio gives a great performance but so does Hardy and everybody else. It's suffering pretty much from moment one, but it lacks a little bit of soul. It's 2 and a half hours and feels a bit long, and like kevinjoseph, it didn't have as much impact on me as it should have. It's hard to hate on anything from a technical standpoint.

  <quote>Enjoyed it quite a bit. Melissa McCarthy can be very hit and miss, especially when she goes overboard, but even when she does that in Spy it's pretty entertaining. Statham is hilarious and a lot of the jokes work. It stumbles occasionally but it's still a good comedy.</quote>

  <summary>A coming-of-age story that follows 12-year-old Andy Nichol (Chase Ellison), a bright student who, like most kids his age, will do anything to avoid conflict for fear of suffering overwhelming ridicule and punishment from his junior high school peers. Everyone's favorite teacher, Mr. Simon (Ed Harris), pairs Andy with the school's biggest outcast and social pariah, Stanley, aka &amp;amp;quot;Big G&amp;amp;quot; (Alexander Walters) on a critical term project. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It does a good job of doing what coming-of-age stories are meant to do. I like that even though Stanley isn't the main character, the movie kind of revolves around him, in a sense. I thought it was an emotional movie, tackling the irrational fear of homosexuality, the importance of teachers, and of course, kids growing up. I didn't find it overly funny so it's more of a drama to me than a comedy. I guess since it's classified as a comedy, that's a bit of a fail, but fuck it.</quote>

  <summary>Until the Light Takes Us is a feature length documentary chronicling the history, ideology and aesthetic of Norwegian black metal - a musical subculture infamous as much for a series of murders and church arsons as it is for its unique musical and visual aesthetics.</summary>
  <quote>I disagree with people who say there's no point. From it, one can learn that there's an opposing voice in Norway that gets misunderstood, media twists shit the way they want, and one can learn things about black metal they might not have known. It has a good mixture of ambient music and black metal. It's not perfect by any means, but it has a certain aesthetic, a visual and emotional sense, that is true to the scene and is just interesting on its own. Pretty good for a pointless film.</quote>

The dialogue is hard to understand at times, but there was a lot of research here. My issue is that for as creepy as it is--not allowing us to feel any sanctuary from the tone--it doesn't have enough moments in it that impacted me. There were a couple, but I wasn't terrified (and I thought I would be). Works more as a drama than a horror.</quote>

  <quote>Quite a step down from Antichrist and a little disappointing (expectations reign), but it was still a good movie. The beginning and end = amazing, and are very memorable. Everyone does a really good job acting here, but big big props to Dunst (and her boobies), who I've never seen as a great actress before. Good direction in pretty much every way and incredible music (I like how it's pretty much one song). But I couldn't get engaged, it just kind of plods along. </quote>

  <quote>It does feel like The Informant in some ways, like someone else said but I liked this a lot more. Maybe it's because I understood the jokes more, and I understood what they were talking about more often. I love the cast here and without them this would be worse. The problem is that it goes for pretty long stretches without a laugh (but has some great ones) and this movie isn't the most emotional thing ever so you're left with a few too many parts where you feel nothing. Still, a good flick.</quote>

  <quote>A few more laughs would have pushed this over into an 80 for me. The beginning I found really funny then the laughter sort of died out for a bit. It's not necessarily bad because the drama took over and it's surprisingly emotional. Still, it just got a few minor chuckles here and there as it went on so while it didn't live up to the standard it started with, this is a movie like Twilight but much much better.</quote>

It never gets boring, and the action is directed well, but it doesn't have the emotional impact that I hoped for. Cooper put in another great performance, though.</quote>

  <summary>Photo-animated feature documentary, uniquely narrated by the 10 people who knew Bill best. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Not a bad look into Bill Hicks by any means. That's all it tries to be, except they use an interesting (though sometimes off-putting) visual style. A good documentary for a brilliant comedian. </quote>

  <quote>I don't know if the fight scenes really work for me here. Not sure. But what I do know is that the movie is absolutely beautiful and it is an interesting take on wuxia. I, like others, found it extremely confusing and I don't know if that's due to the writing or just me being stupid. I also enjoy the score and at the end there was a scene that really involved me but most of the time I was unable to truly get into it.</quote>

  <summary>Jacq Vaucan, an insurance agent of ROC robotics corporation, routinely investigates the case of manipulating a robot. What he discovers will have profound consequences for the future of humanity. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's refreshing to see a Sci-Fi movie about AI and robots that become self-aware that doesn't actually make them bad guys. The premise of this is interesting because of that. However, there's some hokey acting here, it overstays its welcome a little bit, and the pacing is off on occasion. It's still a well shot movie with nice music, special effects and cinematography, but it doesn't end up being anything incredibly captivating.</quote>

  <quote>Probably should have been called, &quot;A rundown of his movies and oh yeah, Bacall talks a little bit about him too,&quot; but I suppose that title is too long. However, there were clips from shows and rarely seen other clips so it was cool, and things like the home movies and whatnot were really interesting. You get pretty much all positive things about Bogie, and the end was emotional and very well done. I suppose I just wanted more about him and their life, but it does what it sets out to do.</quote>

He knows all too well that he falls out of time only once all the magic of the piece will vanish. Will the drummer hold on till the end...? (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>It's pretty funny and actually kinda made me think: This is one of those things in music that has always baffled me... how somebody can sit there and do something like the drummer in this does, for as long as the drummer does.

In fact, the shootouts are a highlight with wonderful music backing them. The soundtrack as a whole is great. It loses its way at the end though, with the way everything becomes a little too convenient and unbelievable. Why can a huge group not see the guns?

  <summary>A restaurant opens for the night. The diners include: A man dining alone, who orders a plate of spaghetti that becomes his dining companion. A couple; the woman talks endlessly (and unintelligibly), as her head mutates into a variety of shapes. Her ravenous companion refuses to pay, and the restaurant reclaims its food. A family with two children; they play, rather elaborately, with their food. (imdb)</summary>

  <summary>The spiritual sequel of Dazed and Confused. A group of college baseball players navigate their way through the freedoms and responsibilities of unsupervised adulthood. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I enjoyed it just fine, but it's not an incredible movie. First of all, it wasn't as funny as I had hoped; it has a few great lines scattered throughout but it needed more consistency. Even though I thought the story was passable, the beginning bit left me feeling cold. It wasn't until I started to gel with these characters that the movie opened up and I became more engrossed. Unfortunately, by that time we were at least halfway through. Finn is fantastic and charming.</quote>

  <summary>With her husband away indefinitely, a young mother struggles to nurture her son in the face of poverty, isolation and incarceration. FLUTTER explores the truest love on earth-the love of a mother and child. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Flutter is a decent enough drama but there are some issues holding it back on its way to greatness, namely, due to the apparent laziness of the mother, it is easy to question the love she has for her son. It is never explained why she has money problems (just throw in a few lines for gods sake), so even though we are bombarded with her love for him, that is an underlying point of contention. It's still a solid drama in every other way though.</quote>

  <quote>After I read more about this, I started appreciating it more. I do like the birds eye view of the people, I think it's a nice touch. Also, the animation is simple but it gets the point across. The way they walk to the music also enforces the idea that the director was trying to get across (a swipe at the Poland system at the time). I went from not recommending this to giving it a 70 in a pretty short time. I guess I just wasn't sure what I was watching at first. Once you know, it's good.</quote>

  <summary>In the not too distant future, two young women who live in a remote ancient forest discover the world around them is on the brink of an apocalypse. Informed only by rumor, they fight intruders, disease, loneliness &amp;amp; starvation. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>I think it's a fine apocalyptic movie that doesn't do anything abnormal for the genre. The regular tropes apply, the same tragedies that generally occur show up here, and it's not boring. What puts this a little above average is the strong performances and chemistry between the two sisters, played by Wood and Page. Let's just be honest here: seeing Page tits after all this time is nice too.</quote>

The dialogue is pretty poor generally, the story is interesting but not communicated well, with some predictability (Kunis interacts with someone, gets in trouble, Tatum swoops in), but I did enjoy the action, the anti-gravity boots, the energy shield, and that long chase scene. Takes a lot of influence from a lot of things and manages to be entertaining despite deep flaws in its storytelling.</quote>

I could appreciate that it wasn't totally black and white in how it portrayed Christians OR atheists. Usually it's easier to just stereotype so film makers cheap out and do that. But these people really exist, and there's good and bad in both of them. Ultimately, the one character becomes the villain, but that's fine. It also didn't cheap out on the ending!</quote>

  <summary>A married couple's life is turned upside down when the wife is accused of a murder.</summary>
  <quote>Thought it was good the whole way through but there are definitely some things I'd change. I feel like the movie tried so hard to make them the &quot;good guys,&quot; and they should have cut that shit out. The flashback explaining that she's innocent was unnecessary... the movie became more about his desperation and the murder was like the money in No Country, it didn't really matter at the end of it. The family was definitely wronged, no doubt, but let's call a spade a spade. But it's very thrilling.</quote>

  <summary>The Four Horsemen resurface and are forcibly recruited by a tech genius to pull off their most impossible heist yet. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>These movies kinda just set it up like they really know magic with elaborate things, such as insane hypnotism or the fact that they handle cards like a prime Gambit, and then it strikes a weird balance by explaining that it's not real magic... just illusion. It's weird sometimes, a little off-putting, but I enjoy the movies because the cast is fun, I have a thing for magicians (not sexually, don't be a perv), and it's just pure entertainment. Not great movies but I dig 'em.</quote>

  <quote>I'm willing to give it a 70 because of the few great scenes (the beginning, the unexpected killings and the ending) but the rest of it is an example of arthouse trickery that hides something... possibly shallowness. The camera often lingers, but it's too much and actually disengages us, and the minimalist, almost non-existent, dialogue between the characters makes it hard for us to know or care. This is a case of going for TOO much mystery, but you have to let us in sometimes.</quote>

  <quote>I am so conflicted. On one end, some of this just dragged hard. Not a lot happened, and I felt the movie sometimes tried too hard to be atmospheric and beautiful. On the other end, the Explosions in the Sky OST helped tremendously (though one particular scene I thought the music was great but was used poorly and the scene was cheesy), and I always enjoy Rudd. By the end of the film, it gave me a feeling that maybe I witnessed something important, despite the flaws. So I guess I liked it.</quote>

Surprising to me since I'm not aware of them but to anybody who is, then it probably isn't. Acting is solid but not amazing. Fight scenes are pretty gory and realistic. It's pretty clean too, meaning, it doesn't beat you over the head with anything. Kind of like Elephant, it just examines the situation.</quote>

  <quote>The usage of monochromatic properties is both a blessing and a curse. It has a very distinct visual style and I embrace it for that, but unlike something like Sin City, which also has a unique digital backlot style, the visuals don't always pop. It's kind of hard to see things once in a while. Low on story, interesting blend of genres like action, adventure, pulpy film noir, sci-fi. Ultimately, a fun family adventure with a few laughs here and there.</quote>

  <quote>By the numbers, but entertaining. Unnecessary characters abound, but at least they got a good cast to do it. Which I guess speaks to the philosophy of the movie: make a good time. Who cares if the character played by Kat is unnecessary and the character played by Portman is very very simplistic? It doesn't matter! It's Kat and Natalie! I don't give a shit and neither should you, go see it because it's entertaining. I don't even like Thor as a character, for the record. But he's done well.</quote>

  <quote>I don't know if this stays in high-mediocre or actually goes to good but it's definitely not Bruno. How much of this is staged? It seems like a lot of it. It's definitely got some good jokes but judging from the reactions of people in the theatre, a lot of laughs seemed to come from shock and I just wasn't shocked.</quote>

  <quote>Pretty solid. Has a great soundtrack, gotta admit. It's very arty and uses its images and metaphors to examine communication and love and whatnot; to what extent it succeeds is up for debate. I think it does a good job, but this isn't a movie that's going to blow your mind by any means. The beginning and end are inspired but the movie suffers throughout the middle. It's in that area where it just reeks of thinking it's deeper than it is, but it ultimately isn't awful or anything. </quote>

But this movie, separated from the comic, isn't bad but it's not great. Everything in it is passable and while it goes too far sometimes with its commentary, it is an action movie that kind of makes you think. But not too much, because the emphasis is on action.

  <quote>It's not great. The acting really isn't that solid, which is a problem considering the actors have to hit a fairly wide range of emotions. The story is interesting enough, if you like these &amp;amp;quot;whodunnit&amp;amp;quot; type of horror/mysteries. I enjoyed it, and the plot twist was relatively unpredictable. The movie has a pretty decent atmosphere and I give props for the music that plays in the credits. It has a few creepy scenes of people looking right at you (always gets me)... solid short film.</quote>

  <summary>A bluntly satiric look at the iconography of pornography narratives, this video reconstitutes typical porn dialogue into deadpan banter, devoid of passion, calling attention to the absurdly constructed nature of the sex film and its audience&amp;amp;#039;s subsequent desensitization.

  <quote>It's pretty funny. I know it's satire, but I don't think it's exactly the deepest of satire. I mean, it's nice that the film is saying it, and I enjoy how it does it, so I guess I shouldn't complain.</quote>

We're never really sure why King John is so bad and the ending is rushed as hell, like they forgot Robin Hood had to be set up as an outlaw and threw it in at the last minute. There are some other story telling flaws but some plot points are decent enough. It also has good acting, some humour and when the movie cuts the shit and focuses on action, it does it quite well.

  <quote>The director is talented and it has pretty cool cinematography. Its creative and gives you something to think about. But the screen writing is sub-par and the acting is shaky.

Over the top to the point of stupid sometimes. With that said, it's still pretty entertaining, even if I think it doesn't all gel.</quote>

This doesn't go into tremendous detail even though it's 2 hours, and sometimes the narrative is wonky. But with THAT said, it's very interesting hearing different sides tell how they feel, and the objectivity of the movie will lead to discussion. Also a good idea to allow Sasha Grey to talk a fair amount considering she's probably the most interesting girl in porn. </quote>

  <summary>A thriller centered on two archaeologists in search of a lost treasure in the catacombs below Paris. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The found footage gimmick doesn't really work in this movie, but I'm a fan of the style generally. I give horror movies that aren't just about haunted houses more recognition than maybe I should because I'm so sick of those types. I give props to this because at least it's different with a cool setting and some intrigue. It doesn't reach its potential and loses some steam once it becomes very obvious which direction this is going. It's still a good time with some good scares and claustrophobia.</quote>

  <quote>Inconsistent but ultimately a good time. I like Hitman movies, and the 3 main were fairly fleshed out with different personalities and dilemmas. Sometimes the stylish transitions and quirks just didn't flow and some of the music choices just took me out of it. The movie has a pretty thoughtful plot with a bunch of twists and turns so that's fine, but sometimes the dialogue felt like it tried way too hard to be clever and Tarantino-esque. Like they ramble about breakfast, but it's not cool.</quote>

  <quote>Quite by the numbers. It'd be nice to see more rom-coms that try to innovate the genre but I mean, this kind of thing is what the main audience wants, not overly critical people like us.

This movie is silly, campy, cheesy and occasionally dark, and it's better for it. It's batshit insane. While some things were wonky, I mostly had a good time here.

  <quote>Watch Chloe's ghost eerily creep up on people who think they're having a private moment. Seriously though, it's very sappy. However, I've always maintained that there's nothing wrong with a tearjerker and I'm not sure why melodrama is seen as bad by default for some people. There is some hokey stuff scattered throughout, and the spirit stuff is a little silly a times, but it's pretty good at what it does. Chloe is instantly likeable and god damn that crushing scene with Keach.</quote>

  <summary>A high school senior finds herself immersed in an online game of truth or dare, where her every move starts to become manipulated by an anonymous community of &quot;watchers.&quot; (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>A surprisingly entertaining and stylish thriller about the dangers of attention seekers and social media. The two leads were good together, and despite the logistics of the game Nerve (seriously, you have to suspend your disbelief hard), it was exciting to anticipate the &quot;why&quot; of its existence. Ultimately, the ending falls flat because the why is not that exciting and it wraps up way too neatly, but I enjoyed myself as a whole. </quote>

  <quote>Despite any wonkiness that exists -- and believe me there is some head-scratching to be had here -- I had a good time. It maintained its mystery pretty well until the end. Neeson kicks some ass and that's usually entertaining. Not incredible, but a sometimes silly, sometimes intense suspense/thriller that is worth watching if you just wanna kill a little time with something that isn't mindblowing but is still satisfying.</quote>

It's hard to deny that the formula is over staying its welcome a bit, but at the same time... at least the film makers get that sometimes it's what doesn't happen that's scary. That's pretty much the premise of these movies. Still, this can be tense, and enjoyable, and scary, and I loved the first one. Just please, don't make anymore. It's unnecessary.</quote>

  <quote>Parks and Long were awesome. 40 minutes (or so) in - Really creepy, great dialogue, some genuinely funny parts. Walrus reveal is gross and demented (great). Should be an 85 at least. Rest of movie - &quot;Cameo&quot; seriously hurts film, so weird-for-the-sake-of-weird . Rest of film is uneven. Tone shifts aren't done that well, comedy sometimes falls flat, becomes a little dull, horror doesn't work mostly, doesn't commit to anything. The end - oddly moving though, and definitely original. Also well shot.</quote>

  <quote>Unfocused and doesn't add a lot to the conversation. I know games, been playing for a long time so it doesn't tell me much.

X-Men movies don't lack destruction, but rely less on fight scenes as a whole than the MCU, making them deeper and more substantial... like they have something to say.

  <summary>When the heir (Ryan Gosling) to a New York real estate fortune becomes entangled in the mystery surrounding the disappearance of his lover (Kirsten Dunst), he might lose everything in this drama set in the 1980s and inspired by the true story of real estate scion Robert Durst. While the detective on the case (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) discovers unexpected evidence -- which turns up the political heat -- people with ties to the case begin to die.</summary>
  <quote>Thought that it built up really well to a certain point and then lost its way. It was so tightly edited and made, and then I just started wondering what the hell is going on? It was at this point that the movie lost like 20 points for me. It's sad really because Gosling did a great job, and I even liked Kirsten Dunst. </quote>

  <quote>While the ending isn't amazing or anything, it's truthful, and for Hollywood flicks like this it's a nice change. Jennifer Aniston gives a solid performance, Vince is okay, but not quite up to par. But is this really a comedy? It felt more like a drama... really threw me for a loop, much like a movie like The Weather Man did. So once I adapted to it and took it more as just a drama, I enjoyed it more than I thought. The writing, direction, cinematography... all of it is okay but not great.</quote>

It's a good movie up until the twist... it's interesting, kind of creepy at one point. After it, it loses a lot but is still decent. Ultimately the movie goes from probably what could have been an 80 to a 60. But expectations really killed this.. the twist is not that interesting. It's obvious. </quote>

  <quote>It's not really entertaining as it is a little uncomfortable because unless you're like me and hump corpses all day, then it's pretty hard to watch. Mostly we watch Ballad run through the woods with a gun, mumble incoherent sentences, occasionally murder someone and have sex with said corpses. It's pretty good at hitting a Southern Gothic feel, but it isn't the most thrilling watch. This works better in novel format, I believe.</quote>

  <summary>Four assassins meet in a hotel suite to resolve unfinished business. A tense drama set in the cosmopolitan world of Hong Kong. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>For whatever reason I had fairly high hopes. I actually like the idea of 4 assassins in a room talking. I feel like there can be a lot of great tension there, plus assassins are cool. However, this doesn't live up to its potential; with shady acting from 2 of the assassins, and weird reactions from certain characters that breaks the flow and makes me go CMON. It's not a bad movie if you're into this sort of thing though.</quote>

  <quote>While the beginning scene is quite inspired, I feel like the movie never lives up to that. Putting image over image like the film liked to do was a bad choice. I didn't care that much about anything going on. Portman is nice to look at but when is she not? The ending was mildly amusing though... so basically the beginning and end are both good but the rest is decent at best.</quote>

  <quote>Should have been right up my alley, but it wasn't. Some of the scenes are awesome -- the last 10 minutes, the cow-man, a couple other scenes -- but I felt it dragged!

Not because of the weirdness, just because that for every weird moment, there was a couple not so fantastic moments. Oh well, original and twisted... worth a watch.</quote>

The movie takes way too long before it reveals much of anything, no scraps thrown to us, where it reveals every single thing at the end. Not the mark of a great mystery.

At first you feel like you're watching something due to all the drama behind it but it does everything it can to quickly unravel that and show that it's just an average Rogan/Franco comedy. Their chemistry is great, and both of them have done much much better, but the Interview is still entertaining.

  <quote>I think it looks good and has some good, but not great, performances, but it's basically an average espionage thriller with a Russian mafia that seems a little declawed. It's fine, ultimately, even if the plot can get a little silly, but there's better out there. </quote>

  <summary>Nick Frost and Simon Pegg star as two science-fiction freaks who, while on a quest to discover what lies at the heart of Nevada's infamous Area 51, cross paths with an alien (voice of Seth Rogen) on the run from earthly authorities.</summary>
  <quote>On one end, the trailer didn't look good. But on the other end, it's fucking Nick Frost and Simon Pegg so I hoped for the best. I got a serviceable film, with a few laughs and nerdy references and whatnot, but this is not even close to the greatness of their other team ups. I felt like it actually relied way too much at some points on just being vulgar, which honestly, I don't find that amusing. When it settles down and crafts actual jokes, it's funny. Though I do like the &quot;three tits&quot; gag.</quote>

  <quote>It's probably what you expect. It isn't ground breaking in any single way but everything is decent enough. One of those movies where it's not a waste of time but if you only want to watch great movies, then you should skip it. Otherwise, just go along for the ride... typical Hollywood thriller-fare.</quote>

  <quote>It's not that bad. It's a TV movie with very little budget, so the expectations of certain elements are lower. It's a pretty entertaining movie, obviously the visuals aren't great but they're pretty good with what they had. It doesn't do anything overly cool and some parts look more low budget than others. Acting was poor to good, depending. The script needed work, that's unforgivable, and the ending was awful. Had it succeeded in the writing I would have given it a much higher rating.</quote>

However, there were a few scenes that helped push this past a 50 for me, namely the end, and a couple little laughs here and there (like at the very beginning).

It's a dystopian film with very little to say and tries to hide that with action sequences that are mildly entertaining. It has the worst usage of slomo that I've seen in a while in one particular scene, and I would have liked the movie a little more if it wasn't for the final act.

Unfortunately, while I don't think it's necessarily sexist, it gives people ammo to think so, and they have material to justify it... which is problematic, obviously.

  <quote>For every bit of good there's bad. A great fight scene may be brought down later in the same fight scene by a stupid contribution to it. Ed Skrein does his best Statham impression but isn't Statham, the music is oddly placed and kinda weird but some of it is cool. It's a typical action movie all around, and the villain has the worst taste in rap imaginable. </quote>

  <quote>I know it's an indie movie, that's why I forgive the CGI. In fact, I actually liked some of the undead/servant designs. That isn't really what got me about this flick. When you know the CGI isn't going to be great, you need to work on the plot/story/script. There's a great, interesting idea buried here, underneath awful writing (really should have said more about the characters and the story in general), and really poor acting. Also, the fight choreography was mostly stupid. Still see it tho.</quote>

  <quote>Yes, a recommendation, although very slight. We won't kid ourselves and say this is a great movie. But it's worth a watch if you have nothing better to do. Maybe the next one will be an actual good movie instead of not just a waste of time. This had fewer wonky moments than Twilight, the acting was kinda crap but I was actually involved at some points. So at least the series is improving.</quote>

  <summary>Based on the 1941 classic, this werewolf-themed horror film set in Victorian England centers on Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro), an American man who, upon a visit to London, gets bitten by a werewolf. Talbot had come to England to make amends with his estranged father (Anthony Hopkins), but after a moonlight transformation leaves him with a savage hunger for flesh, family harmony is the least of his worries.</summary>
  <quote>It's really not memorable in any way besides the goth imagery which is nice. So some good cinematography. Everything else is passable. You don't even need to see this but I'm giving it a 51 because if someone asked me, I'd say, &quot;Yeah sure, see it&quot; instead of &quot;No, rent something else.&quot; But expect the ending to be bullshit.</quote>

  <quote>As much as I appreciate that Statham is this generations action hero, and I appreciate that he does his own stunts n'shit, I haven't actually really liked any of his action movies... but I've really liked his Guy Ritchie rolls. What I'm saying is, I like him as that, but I feel he has bad taste in the action movies he does. This is really basic, but is more thriller than action, so that's okay. But ultimately it's just kind of 'meh' and doesn't do anything great. Passable.</quote>

  <quote>Malick has been one of the best directors that I consistently find a little tedious. I have yet to love any of his movies, but respect the fuck out of him.

It could have been a lot shorter, and watching Bale mope around is not enthralling. Very shallow but pretty, and not in an engaging way. </quote>

  <quote>I don't know shit about the source material. I watched maybe 10 minutes of an episode once, so going in I wanted some action and bending elements. The action can be a bit hit and miss, when it's good it's great though. The acting is pretty poor, the CGI is great, the script is average. Some of the editing is awful, like, there are times where it's just not cohesive at all. Seeing the show would have probably made me hate this, but as it stands now, I don't.

  <quote>Like a few people said, this is boring. 40 minutes of similar shots over and over and over again. But, the imagery is gorgeous and uses some pretty interesting things to make it's point. I especially like the blue football field. It's clear what it's about, and the music especially pushes the idea forward (makes it feel joyous). I'm torn on it. If you can seperate yourself from how dull it is, and appreciate the imagery it's probably worth a watch at least once.</quote>

  <quote>Props for an interesting idea. There is potential here for good commentary and excitement. It doesn't really deliver. I don't know how much it cost but the animation isn't very good. The character models are serviceable (reminds me of Timesplitters and Team Fortress 2, actually), but it doesn't look good in action a lot of the time, which takes away oomph of things like battle scenes. And everything else is by the books and some of the voice acting is lame. Not awful, but skip it.</quote>

  <quote>Did you just kick that fucking dog? What the hell man? Ah, this short is okay. The animation isn't anything great, but when he kicks the dog and the music starts, shit gets real. I'm not going to recommend it because it really is &quot;a pointless animated short,&quot; so I don't know why I even bothered watching it. I saw some animal cruelty though.</quote>

  <quote>Criticker says I'd give this a 0 but damn it's not that bad. In fact, it's not really bad, it's just not recommended. There are better movies to watch. It kind of reminds me of Saw but in a car... meaning when the twist comes around it's kind of like Jigsaws intentions in Saw, if you think about it. Selena Gomez is lovely, Ethan Hawke was fine, and there were some decent moments here and there, but it really just didn't feel like it had a lot of life most of the time and felt a lil silly.</quote>

  <quote>The Coens have this issue where they have a great setup with quirky characters and an intelligent script, and yet they leave me feeling really cold sometimes. This is one of those cases: HC is not terrible, but it failed as a comedy and while I think the premise is fine, the direction is solid and the love of the '50s shines, I just couldn't care about what was going on.

This follows all of the formulaic elements that the genre is known for, but I didn't ever feel like the world was at risk. I know, there was no way that Earth didn't win, and there's a lot of disaster but it didn't feel it ultimately. That makes it hard to forgive the wonkiness in other areas.</quote>

Cosmopolis did that too but I was more into it and enjoyed it quite a bit, but the detached dialogue, the sometimes stiff acting and general weirdness didn't do it for me this time around.

  <quote>Meh. A few lines did it for me and got a smile, but I never outright laughed. I don't know if it's my general disinterest in this era of rock/metal that made me uninterested in this as well, but I just didn't find it that humorous. There are certainly some fine moments so I wouldn't say it's terrible, but this is one widely praised film that I'm just not into.</quote>

  <quote>The film is well crafted, especially the acting performances but that's all it really was to me. This would get an even lower score if it wasn't for those things but I can appreciate a competently made movie, but I couldn't get involved in this. Really, the only flaw is a bit one... it wanders around the point it's trying to make and never engaged me so I found myself getting bored and struggling through it. Others have clearly found more, but that's my word, yo.</quote>

  <quote>Maybe this is blasphemy but I actually didn't mind the movie until the last 15 minutes, where it ended up falling really flat. Yes, it is wonky, Cage acts in weird ways (RAAAAAAAT), and the script is terrible. But I'm kind of a sucker for Cage, and I'm a sucker for movies where criminals reunite to kick ass. I can even stand how tripe and cliche it is because I just enjoy this kind of movie, but some scenes were so bad that it hurt the decent parts. This script needed a lot of work.</quote>

  <quote>I think this is the first in the series that I don't recommend. I really really like the first one, because it was clever and hilarious... this... not so much. Outside of a couple laughs, this really has nothing going for it. It tries way too hard and it fails 90% of the time. If it wasn't for the fact I like the characters and the claymation it'd be lot lower.</quote>

  <quote>At least M. Night tries. It tries to be an interesting fairy tale and while some of it is wonky, it's really not as offensive as people think. Yes, he kills a critic and yes, he put himself as the character whos writing will inspired the world. But the direction is solid like almost always and the script is pretty bad or at most, mediocre. That's what he does usually. But I liked the beginning part and a few parts. The acting had its ups and downs.</quote>

I like Rooster Teeth but this is NOT Red vs Blue any shape or form, except for the fact that they're both sci-fi comedies. A few gags worked, like with the stereotypical redneck Woody, but the laughs didn't come often. I had to wade through a lot of shit to find any gold nuggets. The special effects were totally competent though.</quote>

  <quote>It's not really awful, it's just not worth seeing. What I learned from this film is that in 1909 it was okay to be a pedo.

Besides that, there are a couple good action scenes but nothing amazing. For it not doing anything that well, and for there being so many movies like this, you don't need to see it.

  <quote>This was very by the books, but not a bad movie. It felt like a typical indie dramedy, where a family is fucked up, some 'quirky' things happen (in this case, porn shops and RAGING BONERS), and everyone eventually lets out how they feel at the end. It's depressing that it's so impressively average though, considering C. Hall  is always a pleasure, Silverman is funny, Mara is gorgeous, and Greer has a charm about her. Talent doesn't lead to much here though. Again, not awful, just 'normal.'</quote>

  <summary>A spelling bee loser sets out to exact revenge by finding a loophole and attempting to win as an adult. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>The premise is kinda neat. I don't mind &quot;mean-spirited&quot; comedy if done right, but Bad Words didn't do that. I laughed ONCE, and was most entertained by the final spelling bee, but the rest of the movie was just cruel and unfunny. If a middle-aged guy swearing and being mean to everyone is funny to you, then seriously, power to ya, but -- at least in this case -- it didn't do it for me. Deserves props for the premise, but not even Bateman's charm (which he has in spades) can't save his own movie.</quote>

  <quote>It's possible I just wasn't in the mood. It's also possible that this is just a generic foreign movie. From the unnecessary &quot;artsy/atmospheric&quot; shots (like the beginning and other parts throughout), to the slow-pace, it was a boring movie. I'm not saying that it wants to do a Tarkovsky movie, but they didn't have the same understanding of grace and beauty that he did. You also see a lot of side-face &quot;emoting&quot; with minimal dialogue most of the time, which isn't thoughtful... it just drags on.</quote>

  <quote>Dark and gritty didn't really work. I appreciate the efforts to make it a bit of a sci-fi horror movie at times, but the cheesy dialogue, sub-par visual effects (in comparison to other movies, still not completely terrible as a whole), and the way they punked Doom in about 20 minutes or so... just a bad time. There were a couple scenes like when Doom first awakens, and when the F4 are first dealing with their problems, but it's too little in a movie that overstays its welcome. Slow and boring.</quote>

  <quote>I like found footage movies but this is a really poorly done one. Bad acting, a reliance on jump scares that don't work (quit panning the camera back and forth to make us anticipate a scare, you're doing it to death), and off-putting visuals. It has a few good moments and I'm torn on the ending because it's a little too convenient, but it also has the scariest part (outside of the one scene that's in the trailer). Meh.</quote>

The principal was hilarious though, so it's nice to see that there's at least one awesome character in a crappy movie. Don't bother with this.</quote>

Along with his &amp;amp;quot;mother's little helpers&amp;amp;quot; Sam learns about love and life in this sophisticated take on the classic high school sex comedy that explores a generation of kids growing up too fast and their parents who are desperately trying to stay young. </summary>

  <quote>Fifty Shades is not the embarrassment that it could have been. It substantially improves upon the source material but it's still not a good movie. It is a perfect example of how not to write a script and of the two leads, only Dakota seems to be interested. It's a bit of a slog and feels longer than it is while being decently photographed. It doesn't really matter at this point, nor did it ever, because it has made its money. We will see sequels and we will have the same discussions. </quote>

  <quote>The main character ends up being an editor for a big porn flick. The funny thing is, Finding Bliss is edited so poorly at times it's just lame. There are times when this movie hits a high note and examines &quot;serious&quot; films and porn, and the reactions to it... but most of the time the movie is just a really uninspired rom-com, and there wasn't really a whole lot in it to overly like. They also took the easy way out by making most porn people look stupid, like no movies have ever done that before. </quote>

  <summary>Nick Wild is a Las Vegas bodyguard with lethal professional skills and a personal gambling problem. When a friend is beaten by a sadistic thug, Nick strikes back, only to find out the thug is the son of a powerful mob boss. Suddenly Nick is plunged into the criminal underworld, chased by enforcers and wanted by the mob. Having raised the stakes, Nick has one last play to change his fortunes...and this time, it's all or nothing. (imdb)</summary>
  <quote>Wild Card is a mess. Sloppy, terrible script and Statham phoning it in. He doesn't kick a lot of ass so don't go in expecting that... but when he does it's relatively entertaining, except the final fight which is pretty repetitive and unoriginal. I just ultimately didn't give a s hit at all about what was going on, the internal logic seemed off.</quote>

  <quote>What a piece of arse. Ultimately I just couldn't care; I didn't believe the romance. I think the casting was off on this or maybe they just phoned it in. Maybe a bit of both, though there were a couple decent moments.It was 2 hours and it seemed like an eternity. The dialogue was hokey and instead of being poetic it was cheesy and wooden. They take an hour establishing the central relationship that causes all this but it still felt forced. Decently shot though.</quote>

  <quote>Unfortunately it falls victim to the same problems that many faith-based films do; storytelling is secondary to the sermons and lessons, to the point that it's mostly cheesy and stupid, no finesse. And the way pro-wrestling is treated is especially lame. When he says he's been wearing a mask in the ring and people in his church got offended I cringed. Chris solves all problems with kindness so there's no real drama. Can't hate on the message, but an uplifting scene or two can't save this farce.</quote>

  <summary>Special Agent Ross's (Randy Couture) plans to reconcile with his ex-fianc+ª are ruined when she boards a private jet that is targeted by hijackers working for the same crime lord he is chasing. With no time to inform his team, Ross wriggles his way aboard the aircraft and risks it all to save the love of his life. An adrenaline fueled action packed film that puts the fear back in flying! (amazon.com)</summary>
  <quote>I hate to say it because I want him to be successful in movies, but Couture is a problem here. He lacks great acting ability at this point in his career... in a movie like The Expendables he's surrounded by action stars so he's not a &quot;leading man,&quot; plus he needs a competent director to manage him. This movie doesn't have that. There's no tension, bad dialogue, run-of-the-mill plot, a couple wasted cast members like Holt and Vinnie. Terrible all around.</quote>

Where's the half intelligent dialogue or plot? The music usage is mixed, so it has its moments as well. Since it's a sequel maybe it should expand on the Donnie Darko universe but it really doesn't.

And all because of a number: The Number 23.  (New Line Cinema)</summary>
  <quote>The neo-noir aspects of the book were the ony good part. The rest of it is ridiculous. Let's face it, numerology can be fun and maybe it has a place in this world, but then there's this movie which takes it way too far. </quote>

  <quote>It takes a potentially emotional premise, and shits all over it with a godawful script, shitty editing (the movie jumps around from moment to moment with no cohesion) and mostly bad acting (though I think the problems are more to do with the script... you just can't do justice no matter how good you are). When you're watching how people act in this movie, you're left wondering, 'Did I miss something?&amp;amp;quot; No, you didn't, stop beating yourself up over it.

  <quote>The idea of the movie spoofing the people behind the shitty spoof movies we were getting flooded with is an okay idea. I mean, there have been a lot of shitty spoofs... but this isn't remotely clever. It's not fun sitting through a movie that's trying way too hard to be funny, just for a little laugh here and there. It's as fucking dumb as the movies it spoofs and no, that's not okay if it's 'the point.' Intentionally bad is a fine line, and it can work well, but it doesn't here.</quote>

This isn't anarchism. But it cleverly pretends to be, pulling you in with surface statements that actually slaughter the ideology once you see the context and where they go with it. As a MOVIE, it's completely amateur in the worst way possible. Looks like crap, feels like crap. Plot is crap. Characters are crap.</quote>
